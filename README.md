Core Features:
Customer Analysis: Allow small businesses to upload their customer list and analyze it using Primer's contact database. This can provide deeper insights into customer demographics, firmographics, and behavior.

Potential Customer Generation: Using Primer's contact database, generate a list of potential customers based on the current customer profile. The list should be adjustable with the ability to add or remove people based on custom preferences.

Customer Insights:

Generate Potential Audience:

Use a recommendation engine to create a list of potential customers by analyzing the existing customer base and suggesting similar profiles from Primerâ€™s database.
